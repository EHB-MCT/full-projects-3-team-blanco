        <p class="info">With a surface area of over 3000 m2
            and dozens of specimens, the Dinosaur
            Gallery is the largest room in Europe
            entirely devoted to dinosaurs, their
            discovery, lives and evolution.
            Dinosaurs first appeared nearly 230
            million years ago, at the end of the
            Triassic period. During the Jurassic
            period, they multiplied and diversified,
            colonizing every continent. They became
            extinct at the end of the Cretaceous
            period 65 million years ago. But did they
            really disappear? Weâ€™re not so sure!</p>
